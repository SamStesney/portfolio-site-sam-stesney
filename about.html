            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
              Hi, I'm Sam Stesney. I'm a UI/UX designer based in NYC, though I welcome
              the opportunity to work with creatives from all over. My love of UI design
              kind of snuck up on me during my time as a freelance designer working on a
              full website overhaul for a local restaurant—that's when I realized I needed
              to find a way to do this permanently.
            </p>
            <p>
              My past projects are pretty varied. Over the years, I've had the opportunity
              to design websites, marketing materials and branding resources for several small
              businesses as well as to assist in website redesigns and social media footprint
              improvements. 
            </P>
            <p>
              The fact that I'm a visual person has made me the perfect fit for this industry.
              I notice the finer details when I'm looking at a product or watching something.
              I'm constantly thinking about the potential large-scale cause and effect of a design choice.
              And I love the process of creating the foundation for a product and turning it into something
              beautiful. Ultimately, I hope to channel this passion into design efforts focused on game design
              and development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Design is a huge part of my life, but I'm not happy without another creative outlet.
              In particular, I like to create with my hands—that's where ceramics comes in. Similar to
              design work, I enjoy starting with an amorphous blob and working with the clay and the
              wheel to build eye-catching and functional products. I get the satisfaction of being a part
              of the entire project, from deciding how much clay I need to drinking my morning coffee out
              of a mug I created myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clearly, I'm all about seeing projects through from start to finish—and I love to make that
              happen in collaboration with a close-knit team. I'm open to freelance and full-time UI/UX work.
